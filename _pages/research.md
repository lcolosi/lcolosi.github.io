The broad goals of my research are to better understand the underlying physics of the coupled air-sea system at the submesoscale and how interactions between the ocean and atmosphere at these scales impact the larger climate system. Applying this knowledge, I aim to develop physics-based parameterizations for high-resolution operational ocean models to increase the model’s accuracy at the submesoscale. Achieving this requires a combination of theoretical, numerical, and field studies. Here, I aim to: 

1. Deploy instrumented wave gliders, an autonomous moving platform, and characterize the observations of the ocean and atmospheric boundary layers to understand exactly what is being observed abroad these platforms. 
2. Collect coincident and colocated observations of submesoscale ocean currents in the upper ocean from in-situ (i.e. instrumented wave gliders) and remote (i.e. Modular aerial sensing system known as MASS) assets to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of submesoscale processes. 
3. Develop and optimize physics-based parameterization of air-sea interactions for coupled air-sea models.

This scientific effort will bridge the gap between observational and modeling efforts to study the coupled air-sea system. I am currently involved with the science teams in NASA’s Sub-mesoscale Ocean Dynamics experiment ([S-MODE](https://espo.nasa.gov/s-mode/content/S-MODE)), which is a significant effort to discover if submesoscale ocean dynamics have a significant impact on the vertical exchange of climate and biological variables in the upper ocean and to address important sources of uncertainty in simulating the global ocean.
