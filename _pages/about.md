I am currently a graduate student working in the [Air-sea interaction Laboratory](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanographyn with [Luc Lenain](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/llenain), [Nick Pizzo](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholaspizzo/home), and [Laurent Grare](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XmV-fycAAAAJ&hl=en). I graduated for the Univeristy of California, San Diego with a B.S. in Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences and a minor in Mathematics. 

I study Ocean-atmosphere interactions and the submesoscale processes that modulate these interactions through theoretical and field studies.

I am interested in surface waves, small-scale upper-ocean currents, remote sensing, and applied math. Additionally, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring.

In my free time, I enjoy running, surfing, and swimming.
