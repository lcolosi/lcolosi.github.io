I am currently a graduate student working in the [Air-sea interaction Laboratory](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanographyn with Dr. [Luc Lenain](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/llenain), Dr. [Nick Pizzo](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholaspizzo/home), and Dr. [Laurent Grare](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XmV-fycAAAAJ&hl=en). I graduated for the Univeristy of California, San Diego with a B.S. in Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences and a minor in Mathematics. 

I study Ocean-atmosphere interactions and the submesoscale dynamical processes that modulate these interactions. 

In the Air-Sea Interaction, we are working on better understanding the observations taken aboard the [Wave Gliders](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/instrumentation/waveglider/), an instrumented autonomous moving-platform. Our goal is to use these observations to improve our understanding of the upper ocean and submesoscale dynamics. 

I am interested in surface waves, small-scale upper-ocean currents, remote sensing, applied math

In my free time, I enjoy running, surfing, and swimming.
