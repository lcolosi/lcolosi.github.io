I graduated for Univeristy of California, San Diego in Fall 2020 with a B.S. in Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences and a minor in Mathematics. I am currently hold research positions in two Laboratories at Scripps Institution of Oceanography: (1) undergraduate researcher for Professor [Sarah T. Gille](http://pordlabs.ucsd.edu/sgille/) and Dr. Bia Villas B{hat{o}}as, and (2) staff research associate for the [Air-Sea Interaction laboratory](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/). For the Gille Lab, we explore the intraannual variability of significant wave height and the effects of local wind events on the wave climate using a combination of WaveWatchIII models, buoy observation, and remote sensing. I am finalizing a paper entitled “[The Seasonal Cycle of Significant Wave Height in the Ocean: Local vs Remote Forcing](http://lcolosi.github.io/files/WaveClimatology.pdf)” that will be submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research. For the Air-Sea Interaction Lab, I am working with Luc Lenain, Nicholas Pizzo, and Laurent Grare on better understanding of the nature of the measurements taking on the quasi-Lagrangian [Wave Glider](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/instrumentation/waveglider/) platform. Aspects of the Wave Glider that need to better understood include influence of the mean platform speed on spectral wave observations and how surface skewness relates to the mean height of an instrument on the platform. 

My research interests include air-sea interactions at the meso- and submeso-scale levels such as the exchange of momentum, heat, gasses, and energy. My interests also include investigating the pivotal role of small scale processes such as surface gravity waves and Langmuir circulations in mediating these exchanges. More generally, I am interested in holistically understanding how multiple components of the air-sea system interact to give us the observed dynamics present in our world's oceans. 

In addition to research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. To pass on my knowledge of scientific computing to peers and individuals new to research, I became a certified instructor for The Carpentries in Fall 2020. As an instructor, I organize and teach Software Carpentry Workshops with the goal of improving students’ data literacy and programming skills.

For my pastime activities, I enjoy surfing, rock-climbing, and running.
