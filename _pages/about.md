I am a fourth year undergraduate at UC San Diego studying Ocean and Atmospheric Science and minoring in Mathematics. I work as a research intern studying surface gravity waves with Professor Sarah T. Gille at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Using a combination of WaveWatchIII models, buoy observation, and remote sensing, we explore the intraannual variability of significant wave height and the effects of expansion fan wind events on the sea state of the wave field. My research interests include air-sea interactions and deep water or coastal dynamics of surface gravity waves. More generally, I am interested in holistically understanding how multiple components of the air-sea system interact to give us the observed dynamics present in our world's oceans. For my pastime activities, I enjoy surfing, rock-climbing, and running.
