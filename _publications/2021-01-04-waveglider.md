## Overview

In 2021, I began a 5-month appointment in the Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory working with Luc Lenain, Nicholas Pizzo, and Laurent Grare on a project investigating how to better
understanding the nature of the measurements taking on the quasi-Lagrangian Wave Glider platform. 

Aspects of the Wave Glider that need to better understood include: 

1. Influence of the mean platform speed (i.e. Eulerian verse Quasi-Lagrangian observations of the sea-surface) 
2. The projection of the free surface geometry configurations on the measurements: How does surface skewness relate to the mean height of an instrument on the platform? 

To explore how these aspects of the Wave Glider observational platform influences the measurements of the sea-surface, we will: 

1. Create a series of instructional animations illustrating the difference between Eulerian and Lagrangian/quasi-Lagrangian measurements (aboard the Wave glider). 
2. Examples of spectral differences betweenÂ these two perspectives of the sea-surface. 

Next, data from the Wave Glider will be used to test and hopefully corroborate our conceptional understanding of the nature of the measurements taken aboard the Wave Glider.
